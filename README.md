## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these course projects, the main task was to create a university course planning system. This system needed to manage and display course data, including course titles and prerequisites, and provide functions to load, display, and query this information.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I used an `unordered_map` to store course data for quick access, and `vector` for managing course numbers and prerequisites. File handling was implemented to read and parse CSV data accurately. A user friendly, menu driven interface was designed to guide users through loading data, printing the course list, and querying specific courses.

## Why are data structures important to understand?

Efficient data structures, like the `unordered_map`, made quick data access and updates which improved performance and scalability. They also make the code easier to understand and help with debugging and extending.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Challenges included handling different CSV formats, sorting courses alphanumerically, and managing invalid user inputs. These were addressed with error handling, input validation, and functions to extract, sort, and format course details correctly.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project highlighted the importance of modular design, error handling, and user interfaces which greatly refined my software design approach.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The project improved my coding practices by adopting clear naming conventions, extensive commenting, and a focus on clean, readable code. I also made sure flexibility for easy addition of new features which improved maintainability, readability, and adaptability.
